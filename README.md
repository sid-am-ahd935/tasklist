# tasklist
This contains the list of things I have to do (one day) which is mostly related to software development but can be (in future) extended to contain tasks I will have to do in my life time, kind of a bucket list... wait.. should I put my bucket list on a public website such as GitHub... Wouldn't it be weird?? Naahh....
